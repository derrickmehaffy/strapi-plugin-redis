# API Introduction

This plugin provides a Redis client for your Strapi application. It is based on the [ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis/blob/master/API.md) package and provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for connecting to a Redis (or Redis alternative) database.

More detailed examples for using this packages API will be coming shortly.
